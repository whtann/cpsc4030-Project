            <h1>CPSC 4030: Purchasing Optimum Steam Games</h1>
            <p>The main question we are trying to answer is "What Steam Games are most worth their Price?". 
                Using the data visualizations below, the user is able to compare the games via price, <br>
                positivity ratios, storage capacity, genre, and total number of reviews. We determined the best 
                course of action for these visualizations was to use a drill-down scenario <br> and allow the user 
                to pick which games they want to compare based on genre. This way, the user can use visualizations 
                to compare this group of games and determine <br> which game would be in their best interest to purchase. 
                Each game could be compared through reviews, memory, and other aspects to then decide whether a game would be
                worth an <br> investment and potentially purchased in the future. The user should be able to use our dataset to compare
                sets of games and two games at a time to then determine <br> whether a game is worth the purchase, as well as what games
                would have higher reviews (and more reviewers) than others. </p>
